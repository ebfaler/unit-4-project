# Treehouse Techdegree Project 4: Web Style Guide
 
I was responsible for converting the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I also looked for repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS and stored them in Sass variables. After completing the project, I now have a useful Sass micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites.
